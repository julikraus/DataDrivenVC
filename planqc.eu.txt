          creating quantum computersatom by atom
        

          Our processors use atoms in artificial crystals of light:the fastest way to scale to useful quantum advantage.
        























planqc in a nutshell


planqc in a nutshell


              planqc's quantum computers store information in individual atoms â nature's best qubits. Quantum information is processed by arranging these qubits in highly scalable arrays and manipulating them with precisely controlled laser pulses. planqcâs unique combination of quantum technologies is the fastest way to scale to thousands of qubits, a prerequisite for industry-relevant quantum advantage.
            

              planqc's founding team combines decades of international research on neutral-atom quantum technologies. Our quantum computers are built on the precision of the worldâs best atomic clocks, the worldâs best quantum gas microscopes, and high-speed Rydberg gates.
            

              planqc is the first startup to emerge from the Munich Quantum Valley, which with its vast network of research institutes and industrial partners fosters a unique quantum ecosystem for startups.
            







atoms for quantum computing






Identical qubits
Qubits encoded in neutral atoms are identical by nature and thus are highly scalable





Flexible connectivity
Atoms can be arranged in large one-, two- and three-dimensional geometries and can be individually addressed using advanced quantum gas microscopes







Fast gates
Highly excited Rydberg states enable fast two-qubit gates using laser light





Extreme coherence
Quantum information can be stored in atomic qubits for seconds because they are well protected from the environment














planqc history






2008Optical clock qubit
Optical lattice clock using strontium optical qubit
                  surpasses the cesium standard (Sebastian Blatt)
                  






2011Quantum gas microscope

                  Single atoms in optical lattices are detected and
                  controlled with a quantum gas microscope (Immanuel Bloch)
                  






2015Rydberg atoms

                  More than one hundred atoms in a lattice are entangled with
                  a gate based on Rydberg interactions (Johannes Zeiher)
                  






2021Scaling up optical lattices

                  Cavity-enhanced optical lattices enable scaling up
                  the number of qubits(Sebastian Blatt)
